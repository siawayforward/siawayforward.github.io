A good samaritan told me the best way to grow is by helping others. Duh right? But answering questions on stack overflow does three things:

- Helps answer other people's questions
- Gives you practice your coding and a variety of problems
- Shows your work!

So here we go!

1. [Webscrapping with Python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63963164/something-wrong-on-web-scrapping-using-beautifulsoup/63964794#63964794){:target="_blank"}  
This question was about using the right library to scrape a website. Dynamic websites will need `selenium`. Otherwise you may use `beautifulSoup`. Sometimes, if all you are trying to get is a table, `pandas` has commands for this too!

2. [Java loops](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63974941/how-to-get-a-formula-of-add-subtract-add-vice-versa-in-this-output/63975025#63975025){:target="_blank"}  
A simple rope-a-dope error that can be fixed by changing variable scope to calculate a sum of input values in a for loop.

3. [Excel files in Python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63981188/search-for-keyboard-in-excel-and-extract-it-with-python/63981404){:target="_blank"}  
It was a Sunday, and I was feeling lazy in challenging the depths of my intellectual horizons, so I knew that we could help this person find a way to select specific cells, rows, and columns from their excel data file using Python pandas dataframe functions.

4. A lot, a lot  
This day was a daze in that I couldn't decide what to practice or learn, so we ended up answering more than one question to spread the wealth around. If you really want to see the questions and answers, [go to my answers](https://stackoverflow.com/users/14303095/sia?tab=answers){:target="_blank"} and remember, the 21st night of September :trumpet: :saxophone: :musical_score:
