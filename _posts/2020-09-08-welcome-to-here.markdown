Hello there,

This is me learning and putting myself out there. If you are a drag race fan, remember when Ginger on All Stars 2 said "apparently all you need to win is a corset". It seems the corset in tech is putting yourself out there in the form of blogs, learning out loud (maybe this is a form of proof needed ?? :open_mouth:) and what not. Anyway, these won't always be to learn. Sometimes these notes will be a sharing of experiences as a data baby trying to get hired (FYI September 29 will be my one year job hunt anniversary :worried:). Hopefully someone will find it helpful.

So with that soliloquy, let's get into it :sweat_smile:!
