Heeeeey there! I am Sia, a ~~n aspiring machine learning practitioner~~ data practitioner with seven years of experience as an analyst, manager, and data engineering generalist (you can [view my resume here](https://siawayforward.github.io/assets/Resume_2022.pdf){:target="_blank"}). This mini-site blog of a doll is new and in process, so your feedback is welcome. For that, you can find me on the bird app, learning from some very smart, kind, and down-to-earth people.

**Some of my non-work robot interests include** sports (basketball - more the WNBA, NFL, World Football among others), the two Maya entities (Maya Moore and her namesake, Maya Angelou), Hope as a human condition -> see *The Shawshank Redemption*

**One more thing** that you may or may not know already!

The women of the WNBA are amazing. They can come back to play 53 days after giving birth i.e. [Candace Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candace_Parker){:target="_blank"}, play all year round with no off-season, and fight for social reform (ahem, [Maya Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Moore){:target="_blank"}). All of this to say, if you are not a fan already, check them out! If you are, heyyyyyyyyy :blush:

This is a **WNBA slander-free** zone :heart_eyes: and Go Lynx! :blue_heart: :green_heart:
